<h2>Tips on how to better communicate with an SME:</h2>

• Be **specific** when asking the SME for information. Clearly state the information you want to get, and the time of the meeting (you can provide alternatives so that they have more options).

• Prepare a **comprehensive** list of questions. It’s useful for you and for the SME. The list can help them prepare for the meeting.

• Build a good **relationship** with them. Most people will cooperate better with someone they have some sort of a relationship. You can invite them for lunch and have a casual conversation.

• **Help** them with something.

• Use further **psychological tricks** to establish a better relationship with them. Ask them for a small favor first so that later they feel obliged to help you again.

• Use your **soft skills**. Be:

- empathetic
- communicative
- charismatic.

• **Ask** your co-workers or other SMEs how they deal with that.

• Search for more advice **online**. There are many articles and forum threads about how to deal with an unresponsive SME.

• Remind the SME that cooperating with you is an important part of the process of product development and part of their job. Do it <ins>only</ins> as a last resort.

This is ridiculous addition
